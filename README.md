# simple-googletranslate-php-bot
This absolutely simple that much?

If not, Nevermind.

This repo was inspired from Know How's Blog (but in thai) : https://havespirit.blogspot.com/2017/08/line-chat-bot.html
In the tutorial he using Abdul Platform (Unfamous Chatbot Cilent made by T.Conan Chatchawan from NECTEC) to perform text translation from origin language to target language

But unfortunately, I don't have any server or NAS cilents, the possible method is using "Heroku" to store the code, and then will be a problem, because the Abdul itself mostly called funtion from <b>"HTTP Server" only</b> (Not HTTPS) and I don't know how it can be called from Heroku App (or any server that use HTTPS) with XTEXT command...

However, this repo is for testing and improving funtionality that Abdul can't (like Dialogflow)
